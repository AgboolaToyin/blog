<p>THIS IS POLITICS</P>
<p> The political issue that we would be addressing today is the LGBTQ+ community and their rights. </p>
<p> There is still a huge amount of discrimation surrounding the LGBTQ+ community and it might interest you to know that being a member of this community is considered a crime in most developing countries especially in Africa.</p>
<p> Below are images of members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
